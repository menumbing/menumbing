                 *   This improves throughput by reducing the number of small fetch round-trips.
                 *   Recommended: 512 or higher for high-throughput topics.
                 *   Default (Kafka): 1 byte (respond immediately with any available data).
                 *

                 *   request to accumulate enough data before responding. This is the broker-side
                 *   equivalent of `wait_time` and caps how long fetchMessages() can block.
                 *   Must be lower than `wait_time` to avoid consumer stalls — if max_wait is
                 *   greater than wait_time, the consumer loop may block on fetchMessages() longer
                 *   than its intended budget, causing other consumers to appear stuck.
                 *   Recommended: 200–400ms when wait_time is 500–1000ms.
                 *   Default (Kafka): 500ms.
                 *

                 *   and skips the older ones. The dlq-replay command always uses 'earliest'.
